# Awakli — External Services & API Keys Guide

This document lists every external service the Awakli platform depends on, grouped by priority. **Built-in services** (provided by the Manus platform) are already configured and require no action. **External services** require you to create accounts and provide API keys.

- `server/routers.ts` — Voice cloning via `instantVoiceClone`, voice testing via real TTS
- `server/routers-preproduction.ts` — Voice auditions with S3 upload, voice library browsing via `browseSharedVoices`, voice cloning via `instantVoiceClone`

**Env variable:** `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` — Set and validated

**Pricing:** Creator tier. Starter plan ($5/mo) includes 30,000 characters. Scale plan ($22/mo) for production use.

### 2. Kling AI — Manga-to-Anime Video Generation + Native Lip Sync (ACTIVE)

**Status:** Fully integrated. JWT auth, image-to-video (v2.6), text-to-video (v2.6), **omni-video (V3 Omni with native lip sync)**, and task polling all working.

**Used for:** Converting static manga panels into animated anime clips with native audio/lip sync, style previews, sneak peeks

**Service module:** `server/kling.ts`

**Key functions:**
- `imageToVideo()` — Kling v2.6 image-to-video for silent panels (no dialogue)
- `textToVideo()` — Kling v2.6 text-to-video
- `omniVideo()` — **Kling V3 Omni** unified endpoint with native audio + lip sync (`sound: "on"`)
- `generateOmniVideo()` — Full pipeline: submit omni task → poll → return video URL
- `queryTask()` — Supports `image2video`, `text2video`, and `omni-video` task types
- `pollTaskUntilDone()` — Exponential backoff polling for all task types

**Endpoints using Kling:**
- `server/pipelineOrchestrator.ts` — **V3 Omni** for panels with dialogue (native lip sync), v2.6 for silent panels
- `server/routers-freemium.ts` — Async Kling generation with S3 storage for anime previews
- `server/routers-phase13.ts` — Async Kling generation for sneak peek clips
- `server/routers-preproduction.ts` — Kling image-to-video for style previews, real image generation for character sheets and environment concept art

**Subject Library (Native Lip Sync):**
- **Service module:** `server/kling-subjects.ts`
- **Custom Voice API:** Clone character voices from audio samples via `/v1/general/custom-voices`
- **Element API:** Create persistent character elements with voice binding via `/v1/general/advanced-custom-elements`
- **Pipeline integration:** When character elements exist for a project, the `video_gen` node automatically uses `element_list` with `<<<element_N>>>` voice tags for true lip-synced animation
- **Fallback:** When no elements exist, falls back to V3 Omni with dialogue-enriched prompts
- **UI:** SubjectLibrary component in Voice Casting stage (Pre-Production) for creating/managing character elements
- **DB table:** `character_elements` stores element IDs, voice IDs, and status per project/character

**Lip sync strategy:** Two-tier approach:
1. **With Subject Library elements:** True native lip sync via `element_list` + voice tags in V3 Omni requests
2. **Without elements (fallback):** V3 Omni with `sound: "on"` and dialogue-enriched prompts

**Env variables:** `KLING_ACCESS_KEY`, `KLING_SECRET_KEY` — Set and validated

**Pricing:** ~$0.10-0.30 per 5s clip (v2.6), ~$0.20-0.50 per 5s clip (V3 Omni with audio). Element creation: ~$0.05-0.10 per element.

**Used for:** Opening/ending themes, background music, custom soundtracks, scene BGM, lyrics generation

**Service module:** `server/minimax-music.ts`

**Endpoints replaced:**
- `server/pipelineOrchestrator.ts` — `generateSceneBGM` for pipeline music_gen node
- `server/routers-music.ts` — `generateTheme`, `refineTheme`, `generateOst`, `generateCustomTrack`, `regenerateTrack` (5 endpoints)

**Env variable:** `MINIMAX_API_KEY` — Set and validated (sk-api-* format)

**Pricing:** Pay-as-you-go. Free tier available with `music-2.6-free` model.

## Priority 3: Production Polish

These services enhance the platform but are not blocking core functionality.

### 6. Lip Sync — Handled by Kling V3 Omni + Subject Library (NO SEPARATE SERVICE NEEDED)

**Status:** Fully handled by Kling V3 Omni with Subject Library integration. No separate lip sync service required.

**How it works:** The pipeline's `video_gen` node uses a two-tier approach:
1. **Subject Library elements (best quality):** When character elements with voice binding exist, the pipeline uses `element_list` + `<<<element_N>>>` voice tags for true native lip sync
2. **Fallback:** V3 Omni with `sound: "on"` and dialogue-enriched prompts for ambient audio

**Previous state:** Was a placeholder returning dummy buffers. Now fully replaced by Kling V3 Omni + Subject Library.

## Remaining Placeholders

**No placeholders remain.** All pipeline nodes now use real API calls:

- **Video generation + lip sync** — Kling V3 Omni (panels with dialogue) / Kling v2.6 (silent panels)
- **Voice generation** — ElevenLabs TTS
- **Music generation** — MiniMax Music 2.6
- **Assembly** — S3 storage + Cloudflare Stream CDN
- **Image generation** — Manus built-in image generation

The pipeline runs as a 4-node flow: `video_gen → voice_gen → music_gen → assembly`
